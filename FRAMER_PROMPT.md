Create a stunning, modern, and user-centric website design for a platform called "Study Abroad Final Boss". This platform serves as a comprehensive guide for students aspiring to study internationally, featuring AI-driven recommendations and detailed university data.

**Project Overview:**
"Study Abroad Final Boss" helps students navigate the complex process of finding the right university. It provides tools to search, compare, and bookmark universities based on tuition, rankings, and acceptance requirements (GRE, IELTS, TOEFL).

**Design Aesthetic:**
- **Vibe:** Professional, trustworthy, inspiring, and academic but modern. Avoid "boring" corporate styles; aim for a dynamic "EdTech" feel.
- **Colors:** Deep royal blues or academic purples paired with vibrant accent colors (e.g., coral, teal, or gold) to highlight calls-to-action and key data points.
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif fonts (like Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans) for high readability of data-rich content.
- **Visuals:** High-quality images of diverse international students and iconic university campuses. Use glassmorphism or soft cards for data containers.
